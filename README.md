# Multi-Faceted-Defense-Against-Sophisticated-Cyber-Threats
This project exemplifies my technical prowess in effectively navigating and defending against new generation phishing campaigns. By deploying Docker environments and conducting comprehensive testing, I gained invaluable insights into potential attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. My proficiency in implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, coupled with my exploration of advanced email security techniques, underscores my dedication to fortifying organizations against sophisticated cyber threats.

Key Accomplishments:

1. Cloning a HTML page to create a realistic Login Page:
Replicated a login interfaces through HTML, ensuring convincing phishing simulations.

2. Establishing an SMTP server for email spoofing:
Successfully set up and utilized an SMTP server to execute email spoofing tactics effectively.

3. Creating a Python script for email spoofing and testing in Visual Studio Code:
Developed a Python script to automate email spoofing and tested its functionality within Visual Studio Code.

4. Deploying a Docker to Capture Credentials on a VM:
Created a Docker container to host a sophisticated phishing webpage and developed a script to capture credentials in a human-readable format. Demonstrated the entire process within a secure virtual machine (VM) environment, ensuring realistic testing scenarios.

5. Deploying a Docker on an Amazon Lightsail Server:
Transferred the Docker container to an Amazon Lightsail server using Filezilla, configuring IP, firewall, and port settings.

6. Conducting final testing on the Amazon Lightsail server:
Performed testing on the Amazon Lightsail server to validate and verify the credential capture process, ensuring its effectiveness in real-world conditions.

7. Implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for email authentication and anti-spoofing measures:
Implemented industry-standard email authentication protocols, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, to protect against email spoofing attempts and enhance email security significantly.
